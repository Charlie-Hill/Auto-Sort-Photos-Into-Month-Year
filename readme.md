# Sort photos into Month-Year (Month-YYYY) folder

I created this python script as part of my offline backup procedure for all of my photos.

Running this script automatically sorts all of my photos (primarily from my iPhone) into a separate month-year (Month-YYYY) folder.

The script uses the creation date from the photo's metadata to sort it into the relevant folder.

Example:

## How to use

Copy main.py into the root folder (or edit the root path in the script) where all of your photographs are contained.

Run the following command:
``python main.py``

Wait for the script to complete and you should now see all of your photos sorted into the correct month-year folder from when the photograph was created.
